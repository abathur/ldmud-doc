SYNOPSIS
========
   int mapping_contains(mixedÂ &data1, ..., &dataN, map, key)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   If the mapping contains the key map, the corresponding values
   are assigned to the data arguments, which massed be passed by
   reference, and 1 is returned. If key is not in map, 0 is
   returned and the data args are left unchanged.
   It is possible to use this function for a 0-value mapping, in
   which case it has the same effect as member(E).

SYNOPSIS
========
   void receive_imp(string host, string msg, int hostport)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Handle a received IMP message.

   This function is called for every message received on the IMP port. Usually
   it is passed on to some object that handles inter mud communications.

   The driver first calls receive_udp(). If that method doesn't exist and if
   the driver is compiled with USE_DEPRECATED, it will then call
   receive_imp().

HISTORY
=======
   - **changed** (*3.2.1*) -- 'hostport' argument was added
   - **changed** (*3.2.9*) -- renamed this method to receive_udp(); this
     old version is supported if the driver is compiled with USE_DEPRECATED.
   - **removed** (*3.3*)

SEE ALSO
========
   send_udp(E), query_udp_port(E)

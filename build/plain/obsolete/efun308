SYNOPSIS
========
   void efun308(object item, object env)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   The item is moved into its new environment env, which may be 0. This efun 
   is to be used in the move_object() hook, as it does nothing else than 
   moving the item - no calls to init() or such.

   Don't use it in your own objects!

SYNOPSIS
========
   void add_verb(string str)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   This function is connected to the add_action() function. It will set up the
   command str to trigger a call to the function set up by the previous call
   to add_action().

   This function is now obsolete as the verb can be given directly with
   add_action(). add_verb() remains for compatibility.

   [marion Sun Jan 19 1992 Don't use it. This file is retained because of

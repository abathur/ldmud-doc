SYNOPSIS
========
   void set_auto_include_string(string arg)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   The arg will be automatically included into every compiled LPC object. This
   is useful to enforce global definitions, e.g. >>``<<#pragma rtt_checks'' or
   >>``<<#pragma strict_types''.  The calling object needs to be privileged by
   the master object.

   Note that the auto-include-string is cleared when the master object
   isreloaded.

Welcome to lddoc's documentation!
=================================
Todo: there isn't actually an other/other.rst file

The LDMud documentation is organized in chapters that are stored in separate 
directories described below.

`applied/`: 
   member functions (lfuns) that the driver applies to objects

`concepts/`: 
   general concepts of LPMUD and LPC

`driver/`: 
   some info about internal operation of the driver

`efun/`: 
   the "system calls" of LPC

`hooks/`: 
   the driver hooks

`LPC/`: 
   about parts of the LPC language

`master/`: 
   lfuns that are applied to the master object only

`obsolete/`: 
   docs for features removed from the driver

`other/`: 
   other useful MUD-related documents

Todo: above lists don't include the new "internals" directory, yet.

Todo: need to figure out how to integrate the efun.de copy (which I also have 
yet to convert) `efun.de/    german translations of the efun/ manpages.`

A reference to foo(X) means the function foo as descibed in chapter X, where X
is one of:

   A: 
      for applied

   C: 
      for concepts

   D: 
      for driver

   E: 
      for efun

   H: 
      for hook

   LPC: 
      for LPC

   M: 
      for master

   O: 
      for obsolete

   OTHER: 
      for other

   Todo: I for internal? SE for simul_efun; I had a note for S as well--
   perhaps that's SYS? dunno.

   Todo: add history, info on doc format?

SYNOPSIS
========
   #include <sys/driver_hooks.h>
   set_driver_hook(H_LOAD_UIDS, value)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Arguments: 
      - value (closure(LPC)) -- mixed <closure> (string objectname)

   Mandatory hooks to determine the uid and euid of loaded or cloned objects. 
   Hook settings can be any closure.

   When an object is newly loaded, the H_LOAD_UIDS hook is called with the 
   object name as argument. The new object already exists, but has 0 uids.

   Todo: better markup structures to replace the literal blocks in this 
   document

   For the result, the following possibilities exist (<num> is a non-zero 
   number, <no-string> is anything but a string):

      "<uid>"                    -> uid = "<uid>", euid = "<uid>"
      ({ "<uid>", "<euid>" })    -> uid = "<uid>", euid = "<euid>"
      ({ "<uid>", <no-string> }) -> uid = "<uid>", euid = 0

   If strict-euids is not active, the following results are possible, too:

      <num>                      -> uid = 0, euid = 0
      ({ <num>, "<euid>" })      -> uid = 0, euid = "<euid>"
      ({ <num>, <no-string> })   -> uid = 0, euid = 0

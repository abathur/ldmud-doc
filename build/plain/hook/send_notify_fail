SYNOPSIS
========
   #include <sys/driver_hooks.h>
   set_driver_hook(H_SEND_NOTIFY_FAIL, value)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Arguments: 
      - value (string) -- void <name>(string msg, object msgobj, object 
        orig_cmd_giver) 
      - value (closure) -- void <closure>(string msg, object msgobj, 
        object orig_cmd_giver) 

   Optional hook to send the notify fail message, regardless of how it was 
   determined, to the player. If the hook is not set, the message is delivered
   using tell_object(E) internally. Hook setting can be a string or a 
   closure.

   If the hook is a string, it is the name of a (possibly static) function to 
   call in the current command giver. If the hook is a closure, it is the 
   function to be called. Lambda closures are bound to the current command 
   giver first.

   The arguments to the call are:
      - <msg> is the notify fail message to be delivered.
      - <msgobj> is the object which set the message. It is 0 for the 
        default message.
      - <orig_cmd_giver> is the object for which the original command was 
        first received. It is usually identical with the current command 
        giver `this_player()`.

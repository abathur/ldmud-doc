SYNOPSIS (OPTIONAL)
===================
   string pg_conv_string(stringÂ str)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Convert the string str(E) into a string that is correctly interpretated for
   usage as a string in pg_query(E), e.g. `'` is replaced with `\'` and so 
   on.

   The function is available only if the driver is compiled with PostgreSQL 
   support. In that case, __PGSQL__ is defined.

   The efun triggers a privilege violation ("pgsql", "pg_connect").

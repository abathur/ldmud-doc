SYNOPSIS (OPTIONAL)
===================
   string pg_conv_string(stringÂ str)

DESCRIPTION
===========
Convert the string <str> into a string that is correctly interpretated for
usage as a string in pg_query(), e.g. ' is replaced with ' and so on.

The function is available only if the driver is compiled with PostgreSQL
support. In that case, __PGSQL__ is defined.

The efun triggers a privilege violation ("pgsql", "pg_connect").

Added in 3.3.708.

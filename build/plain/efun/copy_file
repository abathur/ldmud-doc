SYNOPSIS
========
   int copy_file(string from, string to)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Copies the file from(E) to the new name to(E). If to(E) exists and is a 
   directory, then from(E) will be placed in that directory and keep its 
   original name.

   You must have read permission for from(E) and write permission for the 
   target file to copy the file.

   On successful completion copy_file(E) will return 0. If any error occurs, a
   non-zero value is returned.

   USAGE
   =====
         copy_file("/players/wizard/obj.c", "/players/wizard/newobj.c");

HISTORY
=======
   - changed (3.2.9) -- restricts the error behaviour to returning non-0.

SEE ALSO
========
   mkdir(E), rmdir(E), rm(E), rename(E)

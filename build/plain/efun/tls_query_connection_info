SYNOPSIS (PRELIMINARY)
======================
   #include <tls.h>
   int * tls_query_connection_info(object ob)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   If <ob> does not have a TLS connection, if the connection is still being 
   set-up, or if <ob> is not interactive, the efun returns 0.

   If <ob> has a TLS connection, tls_query_connection_info() returns an array 
   that contains some parameters of <ob>'s connection:

      int|string [TLS_CIPHER]: the cipher used int        [TLS_COMP]:   the 
      compression used int        [TLS_KX]:     the key-exchange used int
      [TLS_MAC]:    the digest algorithm used int|string [TLS_PROT]:
      the protocol used

   To translate these numbers into strings, <tls.h> offers a number of macros:

      TLS_xxx_TABLE: a literal array of strings describing the
         value in question.

      TLS_xxx_NAME(x): a macro translating the numeric result
         value into a string.

      xxx: CIPHER, COMP, KX, MAC, PROT

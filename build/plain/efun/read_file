SYNOPSIS
========
   string read_file(string file, int start, int number)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Reads lines from file. If start(E) is not given or 0, the file is read from
   the beginning, else the efun starts reading at the beginning of line 
   start(E).

   If number(E) is not given or 0, the whole file is read, else just the given
   amount of lines.

   If start(E) would be outside the actual size of the file, 0 is returned 
   instead of a string.

   The maximum bytes (not lines!) being read per call is `LIMIT_FILE` (see 
   query_limits(E)).

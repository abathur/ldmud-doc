SYNOPSIS
========
   void move_object(mixed item, mixed dest)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   The item, which can be an object_name or an object, is moved into it's new 
   environment dest, which can also be an object_name or an object.

   <!> Note:  
     For !compat mode, the traditional implementation required item(E) to be
     the calling object.

HISTORY
=======
   - changed (3.2.1) -- the innards of move_object() are implemented in 
     the mudlib, using the M_MOVE_OBJECT0/1 driver hooks, and move_object() 
     might as well be an simul-efun

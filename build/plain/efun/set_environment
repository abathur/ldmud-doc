SYNOPSIS
========
   void set_environment(object item, object env)

DESCRIPTION
===========
      The item is moved into its new environment env, which may be 0. This 
      efun is to be used in the move_object() hook, as it does nothing else 
      than moving the item - no calls to init() or such.

      Don't use it in your own objects!

SYNOPSIS
========
   #include <configuration.h>
   void configure_interactive(object ob, int what, mixed data)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Sets the option what(E) to the value data(E) on the interactive ob(E) or 
   the default for all interactives if ob(E) is 0.

   If the first argument ob(E) is not `this_object()`, the privilege violation
   ("configure_interactive", this_object(), ob, what, data) occurs.

   As what(E), the following arguments are accepted:

   what(E) == `IC_MAX_WRITE_BUFFER_SIZE`
      Sets the maximum amount of data to be held pending for writing per 
      player to data(E) bytes. A value of -1 means unlimited, 0 deactivates 
      the write buffer.

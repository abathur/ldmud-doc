SYNOPSIS
========
   void enable_commands()

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Enable this object to use commands normally accessible to users. This also 
   marks the current object as "living".

   Avoid calling this function outside of `create()` (or `reset(0)` in compat 
   mode), because the command giver will be set to this object.

   USAGE
   =====
      This example makes the current object a living object which then can be 
      accessed via `find_living("dummymonster")`:

         void create() {
           enable_commands();
           set_living_name("dummymonster");
         }

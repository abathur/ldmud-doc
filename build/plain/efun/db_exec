SYNOPSIS (OPTIONAL)
===================
   int db_exec(int handle, string statement)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Execute the SQL-statement statement(E) for the connection handle(E) to the 
   SQL-server. The result is the handle if all went okay. If there was an 
   error in the statement, 0 is returned.

   The function is available only if the driver is compiled with mySQL 
   support. In that case, __MYSQL__ is defined.

   The efun triggers a privilege violation ("mysql", "db_exec").

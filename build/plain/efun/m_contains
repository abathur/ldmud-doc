SYNOPSIS
========
   int m_contains(mixed &data1, ..., &dataN, map, key)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   If the mapping contains the key map, the corresponding values are assigned 
   to the data arguments, which must be passed by reference, and 1 is 
   returned. If key is not in map, 0 is returned and the data args are left 
   unchanged. It is possible to use this function for a 0-value mapping, in 
   which case it has the same effect as member(E).

HISTORY
=======
   - changed (3.2.6) -- Renamed from 'mapping_contains()'.

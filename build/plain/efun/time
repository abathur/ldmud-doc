SYNOPSIS
========
   int time()

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Return number of seconds elapsed since `1. Jan 1970, 0.0:0 GMT`.

   The time is based on the time provided by the host system, but the driver 
   does make sure the result of time(E) is monotonically increasing (ie. 
   changes only to bigger numbers).

   The result of time(E) does not change during the course of a command 
   execution.

   USAGE
   =====
      Print out the current date and time:

         write(ctime(time())+"\n");

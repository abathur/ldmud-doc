SYNOPSIS (OPTIONAL)
===================
   string process_string(stringÂ str)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Searches string str(E) for occurences of a "value by function call", which 
   is an implicit function call surrounded by `@@`. The value should contain a
   string like this:

      @@function[:filename][|arg|arg]@@

   `function` must return a string or else the string which should be 
   processed will be returned unchanged. Both the filename and the args are 
   optional.

   Caution: This does not recurse over returned replacement values. If a 
     function returns another function description, that description will not 
     be replaced.
   Consecutive function calls can be written adjacent:

      @@function1@@function2@@

   Security:  
     Using process_string(E) can lead to severe security problems.

   USAGE
   =====
      Given the below example, calling `func()` will print out the string 
      "abcdef":

         string foo(string str) {
            return "ab"+str+"ef";
         }
         void func() {
            write(process_string("@@foo|cd@@")+"\n");
         }

HISTORY
=======
   - changed (3.2.1@34) -- Because of the security problems, 
     process_string() is an optional efun.
   - changed (3.3.160) -- removed the undocumented 'feature' that a 
     function call declaration could be terminated by a space. In turn this 
     now allows the use of arguments with spaces.

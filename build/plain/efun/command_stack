SYNOPSIS
========
   #include <commands.h>
   mixed * command_stack(void)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Return an array describing the current command stack. The array has
   command_stack_depth() entries, the first describing the top-level command,
   and the last describing the current one.

   Each entry is an array itself with these entries:

      string [CMD_VERB]:    the verb of this command string [CMD_TEXT]:
      thefull command text object [CMD_ORIGIN]:  the original command
      giverobject [CMD_PLAYER]:  the current command giver mixed
      [CMD_FAIL]:the notify_fail setting (or 0). mixed  [CMD_FAILOBJ]: the
      object whichset the notify_fail setting.

   CMD_ORIGIN and CMD_PLAYER are usually the same; there is a difference only
   if the modify_command hook changes the command giver with
   set_this_player().

   Note: any of the entries may be returned as 0.

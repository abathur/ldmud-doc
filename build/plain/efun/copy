SYNOPSIS
========
   mixed copy(mixedÂ value)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Create a shallow copy of value(E) and return it. For arrays and mappings 
   this means that a new array or mapping is created with copies of the 
   original content. Embedded arrays and mappings are copied by reference!

   For other values this function is a no-op.

   USAGE
   =====
      Because the example below uses a shallow copy, modifications to the 
      nested array are visible in both copies:

         mixed *a, *b;

         a = ({ 1, ({ 21, 22 }) });
         b = copy(a);
         a[0] = -1;
         a[1][0] = -21;

         // a is now ({ -1, ({ -21, 22 }) })
         // b is now ({  1, ({ -21, 22 }) })

SYNOPSIS
========
   int next_bit(string str, int start                  )
   int next_bit(string str, int start, int find_cleared)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Return the number of the next bit in bitstring str(E) after position 
   start(E). Usually this is the next set bit, but if find_cleared(E) is given
   and not 0, the position of the next cleared bit is returned.

   Note that finding cleared bits after the last set bit is limited to the 
   actual length of str(E).

   Each character contains 6 bits. So you can store a value between 0 and 63 
   in one character (2^6=64). Starting character is the blank char:` `(U+00020
   SPACE) which has the value 0. The first character in the string is the one
   with the lowest bits (0-5).

   USAGE
   =====
      The below will write `2` and `4`:

         string s;
         int p;

         s = set_bit("", 4); s = set_bit(s, 2);

         for (p = -1; -1 != (p = next_bit(s, p); )
             write(p+"\n");

SYNOPSIS
========
   closure symbol_function(symbol arg                  )
   closure symbol_function(string arg                  )
   closure symbol_function(string arg, object|string ob)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Constructs a lfun closure, efun closure, or operator closure from the first
   arg (string or symbol). For lfuns, the second arg is the object that the 
   lfun belongs to, specified by the object itself or by its name (the object 
   will be loaded in the second case).

   If the closure is created for an lfun in an object other than the current 
   object, the result is an 'alien lfun closure'. Such closures are bound to 
   the object executing symbol_function(E) (this is what to_object(E) will 
   return), even though the actual code is in that other object (which 
   get_type_info(E) will return).

   Private lfuns can never be accessed this way, static and protected lfuns 
   only if ob(E) is the current object.

   USAGE
   =====
         symbol_function("efun::users")          // #'users
         symbol_function("QueryProp", other_obj) // other_obj->QueryProp()

SYNOPSIS (OPTIONAL)
===================
   int pg_pending(          )
   int pg_pending(object obj)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Return the number of pending queries for the connection on the given object
   obj(E) (default is the current object). If the object has no database 
   connection, return -1.

   The function is available only if the driver is compiled with PostgreSQL 
   support. In that case, __PGSQL__ is defined.

   The efun triggers a privilege violation ("pgsql", "pg_pending").

SYNOPSIS
========
   string save_value(mixed value            )
   string save_value(mixed value, int format)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Encode the value(E) into a string suitable for restoration with 
   restore_value(E) and return it.

   The optional format(E) argument determines the format of the savefile to be
   written:

      -1: use the driver's native format (default).
         0: original format, used by Amylaar LPMud and LDMud <= 3.2.8 . 1: 
         LDMud >= 3.2.9: no-lambda closures, symbols, quoted arrays can be 
         saved. 2: LDMUd >= 3.5.0: floats are stored in a different way, which
         is more compact and can store the new floats losslessly.

   It is recommended to use version 2 or higher.

   The created string consists of two lines, each terminated with a newline 
   character: the first line describes the format used to save the value in 
   the `#x:y` notation; the second line is the representation of the value 
   itself.

   The format of the encoded value and of the format line matches the format 
   used by save_object(E) and restore_object(E).

HISTORY
=======
   - introduced (3.2.8)
   - changed (3.2.9) -- added restoring of non-lambda closures, symbols, 
     and quoted arrays, using a new savefile format version 1.
   - changed (3.2.10) -- added the format(E) argument.
   - changed (3.5.0) -- added the possibility to restore version 2 with 
     its higher float precision.

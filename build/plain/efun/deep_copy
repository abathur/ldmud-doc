SYNOPSIS
========
   mixed deep_copy(mixedÂ value)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Create a deep copy of value(E) and return it. For arrays and mappings this 
   means that a new array or mapping is created with copies of the original 
   content. Embedded arrays and mappings are truly copied, too.

   For other values this function is a no-op.

   If DYNAMIC_COST is defined, every nested mapping or array counts towards 
   the evaluation cost in both size and nesting depth.

   USAGE
   =====
      In contrast to the example in copy(E), changes to the nested array below
      are not visible in both copies:

         mixed *a, *b;

         a = ({ 1, ({ 21, 22 }) });
         b = deep_copy(a);
         a[0] = -1;
         a[1][0] = -21;

         // a is now   ({ -1, ({ -21, 22 }) })
         // b is still ({  1, ({  21, 22 }) })

HISTORY
=======
   - introduced (3.2.6)
   - changed (3.2.9) -- added the dynamic cost to the efun

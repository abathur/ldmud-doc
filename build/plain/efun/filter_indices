SYNOPSIS
========
   mapping filter_indices(mapping, string func, string|object ob, ...)

DESCRIPTION
===========
mapping filter_indices(mapping, closure cl, ...)

ob->func() is called resp. cl applied to every element in the mapping, with 
first argument being the key of the element, and then the extra args that were
given to filter_indices (these args must not be protected references like 
&(i[0]). If the function returns true, the element is added to the result 
mapping. ob can also be an object_name of an object.

If <ob> is omitted, or neither a string nor an object, it defaults to 
this_object().

In LDMud 3.2.6 renamed from filter_mapping() and generalised by efun filter().

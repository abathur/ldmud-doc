SYNOPSIS
========
   #include <trace.h>
   string traceprefix(string prefix)
   string traceprefix(int dummy    )

DESCRIPTION
===========
   If called with a string, only objects matching this prefix will be traced. 
   The string must not contain a leading "/" because the object names are 
   stored internally without it. If called with a number, the traceprefix will
   be ignored and all objects will be traced. Returns the last traceprefix or
   0 if there wasn't any.

   valid_trace(M) is called with `("traceprefix", prefix)` as arguments to 
   verify the use of this efun.

   USAGE
   =====
      The following example shows the basics of how to set up (and later 
      remove) a trace:

         object obj;
         string prefix;
         obj = find_player("wessex");
         prefix = object_name(obj);
         prefix = prefix[1..]; // cut off the leading "/"
         traceprefix(prefix);
           // From here on, only code in the object "std/player#69"
           // will be traced.
           //
         trace(TRACE_CALL | TRACE_CALL_OTHER | TRACE_RETURN | TRACE_ARGS);
         ...
         trace(TRACE_NOTHING);

HISTORY
=======
   - changed (3.2.9) -- passes prefix(E) to the valid_trace(M) apply as 
     well.

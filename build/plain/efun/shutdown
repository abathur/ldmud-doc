SYNOPSIS
========
   void shutdown(             )
   void shutdown(intÂ exit_code)

DESCRIPTION
===========
Shutdown the mud, setting the process result code to <exit_code>, or 0 if not 
given.

Never use this efun. If you need to shutdown the mud, use the shutdown command
instead. You may be asking yourself, if you're not supposed to use it why is 
it here? Sorry, I cannot answer that. It's top-secret.

The efun causes a privilege violation.

LDMud 3.2.11 introduced the exit code. LDMud 3.5.0 made the efun privileged.

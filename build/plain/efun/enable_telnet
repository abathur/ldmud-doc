SYNOPSIS
========
   int enable_telnet(int num            )
   int enable_telnet(int num, object obj)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Arguments: 
      - num (int) -- 
        - `> 0` : enable telnet machine (default)
        - `= 0` : disable telnet machine
        - `< 0` : just query the current state of the telnet machine.


      - obj (object) -- the interactive object, default is the current 
        interactive. For non-interactive objects the function raises an error.


   Enable or disable the telnet machine for the interactive object obj(E). 
   Return the previous state of the telnet machine as result.

   The function raises a privilege_violation ("enable_telnet", obj, num) if 
   num(E) is >= 0. If the privilege is denied, the call is ignored.

   <!> Warning:  
     Careless use of this efun can cause great confusion for both driver and
     clients! The efun exists mainly to support PSYCmuve, and may vanish if
     a more consistent way of handling network connections is introduced.

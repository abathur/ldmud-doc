SYNOPSIS
========
   int enable_telnet(int num            )
   int enable_telnet(int num, object obj)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Enable or disable the telnet machine for the interactive object <obj>.
   Return the previous state of the telnet machine as result.

   <num> > 0 : enable telnet machine (default)
      = 0 : disable telnet machine < 0 : just query the current state of
      thetelnet machine.

   <obj> : the interactive object, default is the current interactive.
      For non-interactive objects the function raises an error.

   The function raises a privilege_violation ("enable_telnet", obj, num) if
   <num> is >= 0. If the privilege is denied, the call is ignored.

   Warning: Careless use of this efun can cause great confusion for both
   driver and clients! The efun exists mainly to support PSYCmuve, and
   mayvanish if a more consistent way of handling network connections
   isintroduced.

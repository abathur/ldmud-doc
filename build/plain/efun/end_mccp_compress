SYNOPSIS (OPTIONAL)
===================
   int end_mccp_compress()

DESCRIPTION
===========
   This efun must be called inside an interactive player and stops the 
   compression of the driver -> client traffic.

   Returns non-zero on success, and zero on a failure.

   Available only if the driver is compiled with MCCP enabled; __MCCP__ is 
   defined in that case.

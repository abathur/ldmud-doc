SYNOPSIS
========
   int test_bit(string str, int n)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Return 0 or 1 if bit n(E) was set in string str(E).

   Each character contains 6 bits. So you can store a value between 0 and 63 
   in one character (2^6=64). Starting character is the blank char:` `(U+00020
   SPACE) which has the value 0. The first character in the string is the one
   with the lowest bits (0-5).

   USAGE
   =====
      The below returns 1 because "_" stands for the number 63 and therefore 
      the 6th bit is set:

         test_bit("_",5);

      The next example returns 0 because char:` `(U+00020 SPACE) stands for 0 
      and no bit is set:

         test_bit(" ",3);

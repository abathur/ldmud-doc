SYNOPSIS
========
   int baseof(struct b, struct s)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Test if the type of struct b(E) is a base of struct s(E) (the values of 
   b(E) and s(E) are irrelevant). Results are:

   0
      b(E) is not a base of s(E), nor is b(E) of equal type as s(E) (though 
      s(E) might be a base of b(E)).

   1
      b(E) is a true base of s(E)

   2
      b(E) and s(E) are the same struct type

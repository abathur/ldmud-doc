SYNOPSIS
========
   int execute_command(string command, object origin, object player)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Low-level access to the command parser: take the command(E), parse it into 
   verb and argument and call the appropriate action added to origin(E) (read:
   origin(E) is the object 'issuing' the command). For the execution of the 
   function(s), `this_player()` is set to player. The function also sets 
   results of `query_command()` and `query_verb()` to match the given 
   command(E).

   The result is non-0 if the command was found and execute, and 0 otherwise.

   The efun raises a privilege violation ("execute_command", this_object(), 
   origin, command).

   Note that this function does not use the H_MODIFY_COMMAND(H) and 
   H_NOTIFY_FAIL(H) hooks; notify_fail(E) is can be used, but must be 
   evaluated by the caller.

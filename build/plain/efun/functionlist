SYNOPSIS
========
   #include <functionlist.h>
   #include <lpctypes.h>
   mixed * functionlist(object ob, int flags)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Returns an array with information about functions defined in ob(E). For 
   every function, 1 to 4 values (depending on flags(E)) are stored in the 
   result array conveying in this order:

   - the name of the function
   - the function flags (see below)
   - the return type (listed in `<lpctypes.h>`)
   - the number of accepted argumens

   ob(E) may be given as true object or as a filename. In the latter case, the
   efun does not try to load the object before proceeding.

   flags(E) determines both which information is returned for every function, 
   and which functions should be considered at all. Its value is created by 
   bin-or'ing together following flags from <functionlist.h>:

   The 'flags' information consists of the bin-or of the list control flags 
   given above, plus the following:

      TYPE_MOD_VARARGS    function takes varargs NAME_UNDEFINED      function 
      not defined yet, but referenced. NAME_CROSS_DEFINED  function is defined
      to be in a different program TYPE_MOD_NO_MASK    function is nomask 
      TYPE_MOD_PUBLIC     function is public

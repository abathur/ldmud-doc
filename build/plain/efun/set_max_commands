SYNOPSIS
========
   void set_max_commands(int num            )
   void set_max_commands(int num, object obj)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Set the max number of commands the interactive obj(E) is allowed to execute
   per second to num(E). A negative value means 'unlimited' and is the 
   setting for newly created connections.

   If obj(E) is not given, the current interactive is queried.

   The function raises a privilege_violation ("set_max_commands", obj, num). 
   If the privilege is denied, the call is ignored.

   A 'command' in this context means every received data packet which causes a
   LPC call - actions and calls to input_to(E) alike.

   USAGE
   =====
      To establish a mud-wide default for the maximum command rate, write 
      connect(M) like this:

         object connect() {
           object obj;

           ...
           set_max_commands(100);
           return obj;
         }

      Upon return from the the function, the connection with its modified 
      max_commands will be re-bound from the master object to the returned 
      object.

HISTORY
=======
   - introduced (3.2.10)

SYNOPSIS
========
   #include <commands.h>
   mixed * match_command(string command, object origin)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Take the command command(E), parse it, and return an array of all matching 
   actions added to origin(E) (read: origin(E) is the object 'issuing' the 
   command).

   Each entry in the result array is itself an array of:

   - string [`CMDM_VERB`]:   The matched verb.
   - string [`CMDM_ARG`]:    The argument string remaining, or 0 if none.
   - object [`CMDM_OBJECT`]: The object defining the action.
   - string [`CMDM_FUN`]:    The name of the function to call 
     in `CMDM_OBJECT`, which may be static.

   The efun is useful for both debugging, and for implementing your own 
   H_COMMAND(H) handling.

HISTORY

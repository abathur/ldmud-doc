SYNOPSIS
========
   #include <wizlist.h>

   mixed * wizlist_info

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Returns an array with the interesting entries of the wizlist. Needs to be
   privileged by the master object.

   The result is an array with one entry for every wizard (uid). Every entry
   is an array itself:

      string w[WL_NAME]           = Name of the wizard. int    w[WL_COMMANDS]
      = Weighted number of commands execute by

         objects of this wizard.

      int    w[WL_COST] int    w[WL_GIGACOST]       = Weighted sum
      ofeval_costs. int    w[WL_TOTAL_COST] int    w[WL_TOTAL_GIGACOST] =
      Totalsum of eval_costs. int    w[WL_HEART_BEATS]    = Weighted count
      ofheart_beats. int    w[WL_CALL_OUT]       = Reserved for
      call_out()(unused yet). int    w[WL_ARRAY_TOTAL]    = Total size of
      arrays inelements. int    w[WL_MAPPING_TOTAL]  = Total size of
      mappings inelements. int    w[WL_STRUCT_TOTAL]   = Total size of
      structs inelements. mixed  w[WL_EXTRA]          = Extra wizlist-info
      if set.

   The 'weighted' entries decay every hour by 10%.

SYNOPSIS
========
   string query_verb(void    )
   string query_verb(intÂ flag)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Return the verb of the current command, of 0 if not executing from a 
   command. If flag(E) is 0 or not given, the verb as given by the user is 
   returned (this is the first word from the line input by the player, up to 
   but not including the first space or lineend). If flag(E) is non-0, the 
   verb as specified in the add_action(E) statement is returned.

   USAGE
   =====
      When the user is in the presence of an object defined as:

         void init() {
            ...
            add_action("sing","sing");
            add_action("sing","chant", 1);
            ...
         }
         int sing(string str) {
            write("Your command was: "+query_verb()+(str ? str : "")+"\n");
            write("The action verb was: "+query_verb(1)+(str ? str : "")+"\n");
            return 1;
         }

      the command 'sing ...' will print:

         Your command was: sing
         The action verb was: sing

      the command 'chant ...' will print:

         Your command was: chant
         The action verb was: chant

      and the command 'chantit ...' will print:

         Your command was: chantit
         The action verb was: chant

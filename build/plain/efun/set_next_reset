SYNOPSIS
========
   int set_next_reset(int delay)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Instruct the gamedriver to reset this object not earlier than in delay(E) 
   seconds. If a negative value is given as delay, the object will never reset
   (useful for blueprints). If 0 is given, the object's reset time is not 
   changed.

   Result is the former delay to the objects next reset (which can be negative
   if the reset was overdue).

   Note that the actual time the reset occurs depends on when the object will 
   be used after the given time delay.

   USAGE
   =====
         set_next_reset(15*60); // Next reset in 15 Minutes or later
         set_next_reset(0);     // just returns the time until the next reset.

HISTORY

SYNOPSIS
========
   int send_udp(string host, int port, string message)
   int send_udp(string host, int port, int * message )

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Sends the message(E) in an UDP packet to the given host and port number.

   The efun causes the privilege violation ("send_udp").

   Returns 1 on success, 0 on failure.

   <!> Note:  
     On some machines a failed send_udp(E) will not be registered until the 
     next send_udp(E) - the latter one might return '0' even if itself was 
     successful.

   Limit:  
     If the host(E) is given as a fully qualified name (instead of an IP 
     address), the execution will block until the name is resolved.

HISTORY
=======
   - changed (3.2.9) -- renamed this efun from send_imp(), and also 
     changed the privilege violation string and the apply names.

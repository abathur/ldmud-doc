SYNOPSIS (OPTIONAL, EXPERIMENTAL)
=================================
   #include <xml.h>
   mixed * xml_parse(string xml)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Parses the given string xml(E) as an XML conformant string. The string must
   have only one root tag, subsequent root tags are ignored.

   If the xml string is correct, an array of three elements is returned, where
   the following indices are defined:

   string `XML_TAG_NAME`
      The name of the XML tag.

   mapping `XML_TAG_ATTRIBUTES`
      All attributes given to the XML tag as a mapping where the key is the 
      attribute name and the value is its string value.

      If the xml tag does not contain any attributes, this element is set 0.

   mixed * `XML_TAG_CONTENTS`
      The contents of this xml tag as an array. This array may contain either 
      strings, or arrays of sub-tags again with three elements. (see example)

      If the xml tag does not contain anything, the element is set to 0.

   If the XML string is not well formed, or there is not enough memory to 
   parse the whole XML structure into the array an error is raised.

   The function is available only if the driver is compiled with Iksemel 
   support. In that case, __XML_DOM__ is defined.

   USAGE
   =====
      Parse a simple self-terminating tag:

         xml_parse("<abc/>")           // ({ "abc", 0, 0 })

      Parse a self-terminating tag with a property:

         xml_parse("<abc xyz="cde"/>") // ({ "abc", ([ "xyz" : "cde" ]), 0 })

      Parse a small nested data structure:

         xml_parse("<book language="common">" +
                   "    <title>This is the title</title>" +
                   "    <chapter>This is a chapter</chapter>" +
                   "    <chapter>We want <b>bold</b> here.</chapter>" +
                   "</book>");
         /*
            ({ "book"
             , ([ "language" : "common" ])
             , ({ ({ "title"
                   , 0
                   , ({ "This is a title" })
                  })
                , ({ "chapter"
                   , 0
                   , ({ "This is a chapter" })
                  })
                , ({ "chapter"
                   , 0
                   , ({ "We want "
                      , ({ "b"
                         , 0
                         , ({ "bold" })
                        })
                      , "here"
                     })
                  })
               })
            })
         */

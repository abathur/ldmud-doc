SYNOPSIS
========
   void tell_object(object|string ob, string str                       )
   void tell_object(object|string ob, mixed *|mapping|struct|object msg)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Send a message <str> to object <ob> (which is looked up and loaded by given
   name if necessary).

   If the second argument is a string, the message will be printed to <ob> if 
   it is an interactive user, otherwise it will be passed to the lfun 
   catch_tell() on the target living object.

   If the second argument is an array/mapping/struct/object, it will be passed
   to the lfun catch_msg() on the target.

   USAGE
   =====
      Just tell Wessex a simple "Hi!":

         object who;
         who=find_player("wessex");
         tell_object(who, "Hi!\n");

   This examples shows how tell_object() works with catch_tell():

      Object 1 (living with the name "dummymonster"):
         void catch_tell(string str) {
            write("Received: "+str+"\n");
         }
      Object 2:
         void func() {
            object who;
            who=find_living("dummymonster");
            tell_object(who, "Follow me, mortal one!\n");
            ...
         }

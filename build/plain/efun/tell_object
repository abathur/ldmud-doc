SYNOPSIS
========
   void tell_object(object|string ob, string str                       )
   void tell_object(object|string ob, mixed *|mapping|struct|object msg)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Send a message str(E) to object ob(E) (which is looked up and loaded by 
   given name if necessary).

   If the second argument is a string, the message will be printed to ob(E) if
   it is an interactive user, otherwise it will be passed to the lfun 
   catch_tell(A) on the target living object.

   If the second argument is an array/mapping/struct/object, it will be passed
   to the lfun catch_msg(A) on the target.

   USAGE
   =====
      Just tell Wessex a simple "Hi!":

         object who;
         who = find_player("wessex");
         tell_object(who, "Hi!\n");

      This examples shows how tell_room(E) works with catch_tell(A):

         Object 1 (living with the name "dummymonster"):

            void catch_tell(string str) {
              write("Received: "+str+"\n");
            }

         Object 2:

            void func() {
              object who;
              who=find_living("dummymonster");
              tell_object(who, "Follow me, mortal one!\n");
              ...
            }

HISTORY
=======
   - changed (3.2.11) -- added the 'mixed >>*<<' form for symmetry 
     reasons.
   - changed (3.3.686) -- added the use of a mapping/struct/object as 
     second argument.

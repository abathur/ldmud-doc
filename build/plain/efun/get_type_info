SYNOPSIS
========
   mixed get_type_info(mixed arg          )
   mixed get_type_info(mixed arg, int flag)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Returns info about the type of arg, as controlled by the flag.

   If the optional argument <flag> is not given, an array is returned whose
   first element is an integer denoting the data type, as defined in
   <lpctypes.h>. The second entry can contain additional information about
   arg.

   If <flag> flag is the number 0, only the first element of that array (i.e.
   the data type) is returned (as int). If <flag> is 1, the second element is
   returned.

   If <arg> is a closure, the <flag> setting 2 lets the efun return the object
   of the closure (which for 'lfun closures' is the object the lfun is defined
   in, which is not necessarily the object the closure is bound to).

   If <arg> is a struct, the <flag> setting 2 lets the efun return the base
   name of the struct.

   If <arg> is a lfun or context closure, the <flag> setting 3 lets the efun
   return the name of the program the closure was defined in. For other
   closures, <flag> setting 3 returns 0.

   If <arg> is a lfun or context closure, the <flag> setting 4 lets the efun
   return the name of the function. For other closures, <flag> setting 4
   returns 0.

   For every other <flag> setting, -1 is returned.

   The secondary information is:
      - for mappings the width, ie the number of data items per key.
      - for symbols and quoted arrays the number of quotes.
      - for closures, the (internal) closure type, as defined in
        <lpctypes.h>.
      - for strings 0 for shared strings, and non-0 for others.
      - for structs the unique identifier string
      - -1 for all other datatypes.

   BUGS This function seems to be due to frequent changes as the
   driverdevelops resp. is debugged.

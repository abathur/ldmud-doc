SYNOPSIS
========
   mixed get_type_info(mixed value          )
   mixed get_type_info(mixed value, int flag)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Returns info about the type of value(E), as controlled by the flag.

   If the optional argument flag(E) is not given, an array is returned whose 
   first element is an integer denoting the data type, as defined in 
   <lpctypes.h>. The second entry can contain additional information about 
   value(E).

   If flag(E) flag is the number 0, only the first element of that array (i.e.
   the data type) is returned (as int). If flag(E) is 1, the second element 
   is returned.

   If value(E) is a closure, the flag(E) setting 2 lets the efun return the 
   object of the closure (which for 'lfun closures' is the object the lfun is 
   defined in, which is not necessarily the object the closure is bound to).

   If value(E) is a struct, the flag(E) setting 2 lets the efun return the 
   base name of the struct.

   If value(E) is a lfun or context closure, the flag(E) setting 3 lets the 
   efun return the name of the program the closure was defined in. For other 
   closures, flag(E) setting 3 returns 0.

   If value(E) is a lfun or context closure, the flag(E) setting 4 lets the 
   efun return the name of the function. For other closures, flag(E) setting 4
   returns 0.

   For every other flag(E) setting, -1 is returned.

   The secondary information is:
      - for mappings the width, ie the number of data items per key.
      - for symbols and quoted arrays the number of quotes.
      - for closures, the (internal) closure type, as defined in 
        <lpctypes.h>.
      - for strings 0 for shared strings, and non-0 for others.
      - for structs the unique identifier string
      - -1 for all other datatypes.

   Misleading:  
     This function seems to be due to frequent changes as the driver 
     develops resp. is debugged.

HISTORY
=======
   - introduced (3.2@127) -- in the 3.2 branch, flag(E) could be of any 
     type
   - changed (3.2.1@84) -- added flag setting 2.
   - changed (3.2.7) -- 
     - added secondary string information.
     - `get_type_info(closure,2)` now returns the object from a lambda 
       closure or bound-lambda closure.

   - changed (3.3.276) -- added the secondary information for structs.
   - changed (3.3.548) -- added flag setting '3' for lfun/context 
     closures.
   - changed (3.3.708) -- added flag setting '4' for lfun/context 
     closures.

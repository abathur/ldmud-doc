SYNOPSIS
========
   int rename(string from, string to)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Moves from(E) to the new name to(E). If from(E) is a file, then to(E) may 
   be either a file or a directory. If from(E) is a directory, then to(E) has 
   to be a directory. If to(E) exists and is a directory, then from(E) will be
   placed in that directory and keep its original name.

   You must have write permission for from(E) to rename the file.

   It is only possible to change name of a directory within a directory on 
   machines running System V, i.e. it is not possible to move to another 
   directory. It is not possible to move a directory across filesystems on any
   system.

   On successfull completion rename(E) will return 0. If any error occurs, a 
   non-zero value is returned.

   USAGE
   =====
      `rename("/players/wizard/obj.c", "/players/wizard/newobj.c");`

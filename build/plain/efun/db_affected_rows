SYNOPSIS (OPTIONAL)
===================
   int db_affected_rows(int handle)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Return the number of affected rows of the last SQL-statement that has been 
   sent to the SQL-server via handle handle(E). Only useful for DELETE- or 
   UPDATE-operations.

   The function is available only if the driver is compiled with mySQL 
   support. In that case, __MYSQL__ is defined.

   The efun triggers a privilege violation ("mysql", "db_affected_rows").

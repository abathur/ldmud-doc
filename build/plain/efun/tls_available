SYNOPSIS (EXPERIMENTAL)
=======================
   int tls_available()

DESCRIPTION
===========
   If the global TLS initialisation could not be set 
   up, `tls_is_available()` returns 0, otherwise 1.

   It is not very useful to call any other tls_* efun if this one returns 0, 
   since there is no TLS-encryption available.

   Most likely the global initialisation failed due to a missing or unreadable
   key resp. certificate-file.

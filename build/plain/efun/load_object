SYNOPSIS
========
   object load_object(stringÂ name)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Load the object from the file name(E) (which can not be empty) and return

         destruct(find_object("/std/player"));
         load_object("/std/player");

HISTORY
=======
   - introduced (3.2.6)
   - changed (3.3.716) -- requires that name(E) is not empty.

SYNOPSIS
========
   int command(string str           )
   int command(string str, object ob)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Execute str as a command given directly by the user. Any effects of the 
   command will apply to the current object, or to ob(E).

   Return value is 0 for failure. Otherwise a numeric value is returned which 
   tells the evaluation cost. Bigger number means higher cost. The evaluation 
   cost is approximately the number of LPC machine code instructions executed.

   If command(E) is called on another object, it is not possible to call 
   static functions in this way, to give some protection against illegal 
   forces.

   Commands are stacked, meaning that after the given command str(E) has 
   finished, the old settings of this_player(E), query_verb(E) etc, are 
   restored.

HISTORY
=======
   - changed (3.2.6) -- in native mode, commands are no longer limited to 
     the current object only.
   - changed (3.2.7) -- commands are stacked.

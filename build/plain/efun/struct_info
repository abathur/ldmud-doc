SYNOPSIS
========
   #include <struct_info.h>
   #include <lpctypes.h>

   mixed * struct_info(struct st, int what)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Return an array of information about the structure of struct <st>. If <st>
   has a base struct, <what> determines how the information is returned:

   <what> == SINFO_FLAT:
      All members of <st>, including those inherited from the base struct,
      arereturned on the top level of the result. The base struct is
      signified byjust its name.

   <what> == SINFO_NESTED:
      Only the members defined in <st> itself are returned on the top level
      ofthe result. The information for the base struct is an array by
      itself,as it would be returned by a call to struct_info() for a base
      structinstance.

   The elements in the resulting array are:

      string [SI_NAME]:        the name of the struct string
      [SI_PROG_NAME]:the name of program defining the struct string
      [SI_PROG_ID]:     the idof the program defining the struct mixed
      [SI_BASE]:        0, or thebase struct information mixed
      >>*<<[SI_MEMBER+0]:    the first memberinformation mixed
      >>*<<[SI_MEMBER+n]:    the last member information

   The member information entries are arrays themselves with these elements:

      string [SIM_NAME]:  name of the member int    [SIM_TYPE]:  the type of
      the member (compile-time value) string [SIM_EXTRA]: 0, or if the member
      is a struct, the

         struct name

SYNOPSIS (DEPRECATED)
=====================
   string make_shared_string(stringÂ str)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Puts str(E) in the table of shared strings of the game.

   If the string is used by several variables/objects this saves memory. Keys 
   of alists and mappings are always shared strings.

   In LDMud 3.3, this function is no longer necessary: strings are shared as 
   much as possible anyway, and the driver automatically converts untabled 
   strings into tabled strings after some time.

HISTORY
=======
   - introduced (3.2.6) -- following a suggestion from Tubmud.
   - deprecated (3.3.531) -- This function is no longer necessary because 
     strings are shared as much as possible anyway, and the driver 
     automatically converts untabled strings into tabled strings after some 
     time.

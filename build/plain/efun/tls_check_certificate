SYNOPSIS (EXPERIMENTAL)
=======================
   mixed * tls_check_certificate(object obj           )
   mixed * tls_check_certificate(object obj, int extra)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Checks the certificate of the secured connection bound to obj(E) (default 
   is the current object). An error is thrown if obj(E) is not interactive or 
   TLS is not available.

   An error is also thrown if obj(E) doesn't have a secure connection up and 
   running.

   Otherwise, the result is an array with these values:

   <!> Note:  
     An X509 certificate can have more than one object with the same name.

HISTORY
=======
   - introduced (3.3.672/3.2.11)
   - changed (3.3.711/3.2.12) -- modified the behaviour to return the low-
     level API result value, and to throw an error if the connection is not 
     secure.

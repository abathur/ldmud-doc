SYNOPSIS (EXPERIMENTAL)
=======================
   void tls_deinit_connection(objectÂ ob)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Shuts down a TLS connection to the interactive object ob(E) 
   (or `this_object()` if ob(E) is not given) but the connection is not 
   closed.

   Under normal circumstances there is no need to use this efun: most clients 
   operate in either secure or unsecure mode, but don't allow switching 
   connection security on the fly.

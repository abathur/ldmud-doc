SYNOPSIS
========
   void ed(                        )
   void ed(string file             )
   void ed(string file, string func)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Calling without arguments will start the editor ed with the name of the 
   error file, that was returned by `master->valid_read(0, geteuid(this_playe
   r()), "ed_start", this_player())`, usually something like `~/.err`. If that
   file is empty, ed will immediatly exit again. Calling ed(E) with file(E) 
   will start the editor on the specified path. If the optional argument func 
   is given, this function will be called after exiting the editor.

   The editor ed is almost `ed(1)` compatible.

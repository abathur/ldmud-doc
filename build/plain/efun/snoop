SYNOPSIS
========
   object snoop(object snooper                )
   object snoop(object snooper, object snoopee)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Starts a snoop from snooper(E) on snoopee(E), or if snoopee(E) is not 
   given, terminates any snoop from snooper(E).

   Return snoopee(E) on success, or 0 for a failure (including snooping 
   loops).

   The snoop is checked with the master object for validity. It will also fail
   if a snoop would result in a recursive snoop action.

   snooper(E) can be an interactive player or an object. If it is an 
   interactive player, the snooped text is prepended with a '%' and sent 
   directly to the player's connection. If snooper(E) is an object, the 
   snooped text is sent in two calls to the object's catch_tell(A) lfun: the 
   first call passes just the "%" (plus the prompt if the object changed it), 
   the second the actual text.

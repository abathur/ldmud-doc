SYNOPSIS
========
   mixed restore_value(stringÂ str)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Decode the string representation str(E) of a value back into the value 
   itself and return it. str(E) is a string as generated by save_value(E).

   The `#x:y` version specification of the saveformat is optional, however the
   driver will assume the old format version 0 in this case. It is strongly 
   recommended to regard the version specification as non-optional in newly 
   saved values.

HISTORY
=======
   - introduced (3.2.8)
   - changed (3.2.9) -- added restoring of non-lambda closures, symbols, 
     and quoted arrays, using a new savefile format version 1.
   - changed (3.5.0) -- added the possibility to restore version 2 with 
     its higher float precision.

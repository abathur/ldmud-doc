SYNOPSIS
========
   string read_bytes(string file, int start, int number)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Reads a given amount of bytes from file. If start(E) is not given or 0, the
   file is read from the beginning, else from byte start(E) on. If start(E) 
   is negative, it is counted from the end of the file. number(E) is the 
   number of bytes to read. 0 or negative values are possible, but not useful.
   If start(E) would be outside the actual size of the file, 0 is returned 
   instead of a string.

   The maximum bytes being read per call is `LIMIT_BYTE` (see 
   query_limits(E)).

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Find the input_to most recently added to the interactive player(E) object 
   matching the fun(E) argument:

   - fun(E) is a string: the input_to functionname has to match
   - fun(E) is an object: the object the input_to function is bound to has
     to match
   - fun(E) is a closure: the input_to closure has to match.
   - ob(E) and fun(E) are given: both the object and the functionname have
     to match

   Return -1 if not found, or the position in the input_to stack (0 being 
   _least_ recently added input_to).

SYNOPSIS
========
   string to_string      (mixed)
          (string)<value>(     )

DESCRIPTION
===========
   The argument is converted to a string. Works with int, float, object, 
   arrays, structs, symbols, strings and closures.

   Converts closures and structs into an appropriate name (this has mostly 
   debugging purposes).

   <!> Warning:  
     Arrays are considered exploded strings, ie. arrays of char codes, and 
     are 'imploded' up to the first non-number entry, whatever comes first. 
     That means that `to_string(({ 49, 50 }))` will return `12` and 
     not `({ 49, 50 })`.

   Limit:  
     The cast notation only works if the precise type of <value> is known at
     compile-time. This will not be fixed--use the function form instead.

HISTORY

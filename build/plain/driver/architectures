SYNOPSIS
========
   architectures

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Actively supported and tested architectures:

   - i386
   - x86_64 (work in progress until the release of 3.5.0)

   Other architectures can't be tested by us. Many will probably work as well.
   Your mileage may vary, but we encourage you to test it. And please tell us
   about your experiences.

   Platforms which require aligned memory access seem to be not used by
   theusers of LDMud (e.g. ARM, PowerPC, Sparc). For the sake of code
   simplicityand/or speed some code pieces (bytecode, murmur hash functions)
   don't careabout alignment. On these platforms, the driver will probably not
   work atall right now. That can be fixed, but only if needed (there are
   users) andif the potential users support us (e.g. testing).

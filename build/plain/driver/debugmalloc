SYNOPSIS
========
   debugmalloc

DESCRIPTION
===========
   This command is hardcoded into the driver.

   Toggles the debug mode for the memory managment. If the O_IS_WIZARD flag is
   used in the mudlib (i.e. if set_is_wizard() was called), this command is
   allowed only for users that have this flag set.

HISTORY
=======
   - **changed** (*3.2.7*) -- Deactivated by default, it was effectless
     before anyway.

SEE ALSO
========
   malloc, status, *memory*, *objects*, debug_info(E), set_is_wizard(E)

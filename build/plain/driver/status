SYNOPSIS
========
   status       ()
   status tables()
   status swap  ()
   status malloc()

DESCRIPTION
===========
   This command is hardcoded into the driver's input routine. It displays
   information about the run status of the system. If the O_IS_WIZARD flag is
   used in the mudlib (i.e. if set_is_wizard() was called), this command is
   allowed only for users that have this flag set.

HISTORY
=======
   - **changed** (*3.2.7*) -- added the 'status malloc' variant.

SEE ALSO
========
   malloc, *memory*, *objects*, debug_info(E), set_is_wizard(E)

SYNOPSIS (DEPRECATED)
=====================
   int drop(void        )
   int drop(intÂ silently)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   In compat mode this lfun is used by transfer(E).

   It is called to check if an object wants to be moved out of the inventory 
   of a living object. drop(A) should return 1 to prevent dropping. This is 
   the opposite of the get(A) function. That is because if drop(A) is not 
   defined, it will always be possible to drop an object.

   If the object self-destructs when drop(A) is called, be sure to return 1, 
   as the destructed item surely not can be dropped.

   Most compat mode LPC libraries to define one argument for drop. If silently
   is true, no messages should be written.

HISTORY

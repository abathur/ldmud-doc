SYNOPSIS (DEPRECATED)
=====================
   int get()

DESCRIPTION
===========
   In compat mode, this function is used by transfer()(E).

   If an object wants control over when it is possible to pick it up (i.e. 
   moved into a living object) it must define get(A), and return 1 if ok to 
   pick up.

   <!> Note:  
     `id()` has been called before this to identify the object.

HISTORY
=======
   - deprecated (3.3) -- because transfer()(E) has been deprecated.

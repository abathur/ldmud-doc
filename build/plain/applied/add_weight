SYNOPSIS (DEPRECATED)
=====================
   int add_weight(int w)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   In compat mode, this function is used by transfer(E).

   An object that can contain other objects and is not a room must define this
   function. It is called with the extra weight of the object that is moved 
   into it. If this is ok, then it has to increment the local weight count, 
   and return true. Otherwise, return false, and the new object can not be 
   entered into this object.

   The function is also called with the negative weight in the object that the
   moving leaves.

   <!> Note:  
     no `set_weight()` is required by the parser.

HISTORY
=======
   - deprecated (3.3) -- because transfer(E) has been deprecated.

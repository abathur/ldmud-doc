SYNOPSIS
========
   void catch_msg(mixed *|struct|mapping|object msg, object obj)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   When say()(E), tell_room()(E) or tell_object()(E) are used with a non-
   string as message, the value will be passed to catch_msg(A) in all living 
   objects that can hear it, instead of writing to the user resp. sending to 
   catch_tell(A). This can be used to implement communication protocols 
   between livings. The second argument denotes the object that has sent the 
   message.

HISTORY
=======
   - changed (3.2.11) -- added `tell_object()` to the efuns calling this 
     lfun for symmetry reasons.
   - changed (3.3.686) -- added the use of a mapping/struct/object as 
     message value.

SEE ALSO
========
   say()(E), tell_room()(E), catch_tell(A)

SYNOPSIS

   void exit(objectÂ ob)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   This function was used in compat mode drivers in context with moving 
   objects. Nowadays objects are moved by means of the move_object(H) hooks, 
   and use of this lfun is up to the mudlib.

   This function was called in the old environment everytime a living object 
   ob leaves it.

   this_player(E) will return a random value, don't use it at this point.

   <!> Warning:  
     An error in this function will leave the player stranded in the current
     room until the next reboot.

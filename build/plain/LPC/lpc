DIRECTORY
=========
   LPC

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Todo: vary this language depending on whether we're generating HTML or 
   plaintext (or make it generic enough to suit both)

   This directory contains man pages about various aspects of the LPC language
   as it is provided by Amylaar's parser/driver.

   Todo: consider breaking this down into feature categories for easier 
   browsing?

   - arrays
   - arrow
   - block
   - guide to closures
   - closures
   - closures example
   - comments
   - do-while
   - ed
   - efuns
   - escape
   - float
   - for
   - foreach
   - functions
   - if
   - index
   - inherit
   - inline-closures
   - int
   - lfuns
   - mappings
   - A step-by-step introduction to mappings
   - mixed
   - modifiers
   - object
   - operators
   - pragma
   - preprocessor
   - references
   - status
   - string
   - struct
   - switch
   - symbol
   - types
   - unions
   - varargs
   - void
   - while

   Todo: when we use the TOC method of generating links instead of the 
   explicit one, we don't get the benefit of the ref-specific styling. For 
   most of these docs this is irrelephant, but at least of this writing the 
   plaintext copy for the mapping guide gives us no clue as to what file it's 
   in. This may just be an artifact of the present decision to define both the
   mapping type AND include the mapping guide in mappings.rst as top-level 
   directives, (problem may self-resolve when I address that...)

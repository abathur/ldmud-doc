   symbol

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Identifier names, which in essence are quoted strings. They are used to 
   compute lambda closures, e.g. instead of ({..., 'ident, ... }) you can 
   write declare a 'symbol' variable foo, compute a value for it, and then 
   create the closure as ({ ..., foo, ... })

   Todo: fill this out

   float

DESCRIPTION
===========
   A floating point number in the absolute range __FLOAT_MIN__ to 
   __FLOAT_MAX__ (typically 1e-38 to 1e+38). Floating point numbers are 
   signified by a '.' appearing, e.g. '1' is integer 1, but '1.' is floating-
   point 1 .

   Todo: we don't really document that exponential notation is completely 
   valid; needs a syntax def

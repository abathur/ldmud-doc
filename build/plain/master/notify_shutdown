SYNOPSIS
========
   varargs void notify_shutdown(stringÂ crash_reason)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Notify the master about an immediate shutdown. If crash_reason(M) is 0, it 
   is a normal shutdown, otherwise it is a crash and crash_reason(M) gives a 
   hint at the reason.

   The function has the opportunity to perform any cleanup operation, like 
   informing the mudwho server that the mud is down. This can not be done when
   remove_player(M) is called because the udp connectivity is already gone 
   then.

   - If the gamedriver shuts down normally, this is the last function 
     called before the mud shuts down the udp connections and the accepting 
     socket for new players.
   - If the gamedriver crashes, this is the last function called before 
     the mud attempts to dump core and exit. The following crash reasons 
     aredefined:
     - "Fatal Error": an internal sanity check failed.
     <!> Warning:  
       Since the driver is in an unstable state, this function may not be 
       able to run to completion!


HISTORY
=======
   - changed (3.2.9) -- added the crash_reason(M) argument and that the 
     function is called for a crash at all.

SYNOPSIS
========
   object connect(void)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Return a login object that the requested connection should be bound to.

   At call time, the connection is bound to the master object, and will be re-
   bound to the returned object.

   The lfun logon(A) will be applied to the login object after binding the 
   connection to it. That lfun has to return != 0 to indicate success.

   If connect(M) initiates a secure connection without setting a callback, and
   the connection is still handshaking at the time connect(M) returns, the 
   driver will delay the call to logon(A) until the handshake either succeeds 
   or fails.

HISTORY
=======
   - changed (3.2.13/3.3.713) -- streamlined the handling of secure 
     connections during logon.

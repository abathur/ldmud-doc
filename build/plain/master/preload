SYNOPSIS
========
   void preload(string file)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Load the object with the given file name (which was returned by epilog(M)).
   It is the task of the epilog(M)/preload(M) pair to ensure the validity of 
   the given strings (e.g. filtering out comments and blank lines). For 
   preload itself a `call_other(file, "???")` is sufficient, but it should be 
   guarded by a catch(E) to avoid premature blockings. Also it is wise to 
   change the master's euid from root_uid to something less privileged for the
   time of the preload.

   You can of course do anything else with the passed strings--preloading is 
   just the traditional task.

Introduction
============
Todo: directory thing re: html/plain

This directory contains descriptions for the functions that LDMud expects to
find in the master object (similar to lfuns, but for the master object only).
The name of the master object is hardcoded in the parser, but can also be
specified on the commandline (usually to "secure/master").

The master is the gateway between the interpreter and the mudlib to perform
actions with mudlib specific effects. Calls to the master by the interpreter
have an automatic catch() in effect. Functions to be called by the driver can
be public or static, but not private.

Note that the master is loaded first of all objects. Thus you shouldn't
inherit an other object, nor is the compiler able to search include files
(read: they must be specified with full path).

Note: you can inherit, but the file will be
loaded then before the master, which isn't good for most files.

SYSTEM STARTUP
==============
   The Initialisation functions are called after (re)loading the master to
   establish the most basic operation parameters.

   The initialisation of the mud on startup follows this schedule:

   - The interpreter evaluates the commandline options and initializes
     itself.
   - The master is loaded, but since the driverhooks are not set yet, no
     standard initialisation lfun is called.
   - get_master_uid() is called. If the result is valid, it becomes the
     masters uid.
   - inaugurate_master() is called.
   - flag() is called for each given '-f' commandline option.
   - get_simul_efun() is called.
   - the WIZLIST is read in.
   - epilog() is called. If it returns an array of strings, they are given
     one at a time as argument to preload(). Traditionally, these stringsare
     the filenames of the objects to pre-load, which preload() thendoes.
   - The interpreter sets up the IP communication and enters the backend
     loop.

RELOADED MASTER OBJECT
======================
   If the master is reloaded during system operation, these actions are taken:

   - The master is loaded, and its initialisation lfun is called according
     to the settings of the driverhooks (if set).
   - Any auto-include string and all driverhooks are cleared.
   - get_master_uid() is called. If the result is valid, it becomes the
     masters uid and euid.
   - inaugurate_master() is called.

DESTRUCTED MASTER OBJECT
========================
   If the master was destructed, but couldn't be reloaded, the old master
   object could be reactivated. In that case:

   - reactivate_destructed_master() is called.
   - inaugurate_master() is called.

MASTER FUNCTION REFERENCE
=========================
   The following is a short reference to all expected master functions,
   categorized for easier reading. There is also an alphabetical index of all
   master-object topics and functions at the end of the document.

   Todo: the below was tagged "Security hint" in our docs; it might be nice to
   either have a separate directive for security issues, or be able to supply
   a type/category option to the other admonitions (i.e., use directives like
   note, warning, hint, tip, but be able to supply a :category: security,
   etc.)

   Todo: this is another case where being able to pull part of this from the
   target would be nice; I wonder if a >>:role:`ref`<< can be magicked into an
   expansion based on the target? If nothing else, make these into links

SYNOPSIS
========
   void runtime_warning(string msg, string curobj, string prog, int line, int inside_catch)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   This function is called to let the mudlib handle a runtime warning, e.g. by
   logging it to a database.

   - msg(M) is the warning message.
   - curobj(M) is the name of the current object which caused the message 
     (the object itself might already be destructed), or 0 if there is none.
   - prog(M), line(M) determine the name of the program and the line where
     the error occured if the current object exists, otherwise they are 0.
   - inside_catch(M) : != 0 if the warning occurs inside a catch(E).

   Limit:  
     The driver is limited to three nested warnings, to prevent an endless 
     recursion in case runtime_warning(M) itself causes warnings.

HISTORY
=======
   - introduced (3.3.551)
   - changed (3.3.705) -- added the inside_catch(M) argument.

SYNOPSIS
========
   string get_bb_uid(void)

DESCRIPTION
===========
   This method is called when process_string(E) is used without a current 
   object (e.g. from notify_fail method). The current object will be set to 
   the current command giver, and will receive the euid returned from this 
   function.

   If strict-euids, this function must exist and return a string. Otherwise 
   the function is optional and/or may return 0.

HISTORY
=======
   - changed (3.2.1) -- get_bb_uid(M) is needed just for process_string(E)
     if no `this_object()` is present.

SEE ALSO
========
   >>:concept:`uids`<<, creator(E), get_master_uid(M)

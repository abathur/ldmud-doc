   telnet

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Todo: the docs for both no_echo and telnet_neg have a see-also crossref for
   telnet(C) which doesn't exist (and never has, as far as I can 
   tell.)Explanations probably include: - the reference was to the wrong 
   location, and it's really supposed to be to an RFC or manpage or something 
   - the doc existed but was accidentally nuked before existing version 
   history - the doc was supposed to be made and never was

TYPE
====
      literal constructor:
          ""

DESCRIPTION
===========
   Strings in lpc are true strings, not arrays of characters as in C (and not 
   pointers to strings). Strings are mutable -- that is, the contents of a 
   string can be modified as needed.

   The text of a string is written between double-quotes ("). A string can 
   written over several lines when the lineends are escaped (like a macro), 
   however a better solution is to write one string per line and let the 
   gamedriver concatenate them.

   String text typically consists of literal characters, but escape-sequences 
   can be used instead of characters:

   `\N`
      the character code N in decimal

   `\0xN`
      the character code N in sedecimal

   `\xN`
      the character code N in sedecimal

   `\0oN`
      the character code N in octal

   `\0bN`
      the character code N in binary

   `\a`
      Bell (`0x07`)

   `\b`
      Backspace (`0x08`)

   `\t`
      Tab (`0x09`)

   `\e`
      Escape (`0x1b`)

   `\n`
      Newline (`0x0a`)

   `\f`
      Formfeed (`0x0c`)

   `\r`
      Carriage Return (`0x0d`)

   `\<otherÂ character>`
      the given character

   Adjacent string literals are automatically concatenated by the driver when 
   the LPC program is compiled. String literals joined with '+' are 
   concatenated by the LPC compiler as well.

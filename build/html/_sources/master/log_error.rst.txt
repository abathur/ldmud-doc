.. master:: void log_error(string file, string err, int warn)

  Announce a compiler-time error (warn == 0) or warning (warn != 0) in the named file.

  Whenever the LPC compiler detects an error or issues a warning, this function is called. It should at least log the error in a file, and also announce it to the active user.

  :history 3.2.8 changed: added the 'warn' argument and the warnings in general

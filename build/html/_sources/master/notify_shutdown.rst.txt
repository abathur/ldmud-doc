.. master:: varargs void notify_shutdown(string crash_reason)

  Notify the master about an immediate shutdown. If :arg:`crash_reason` is 0, it is a normal shutdown, otherwise it is a crash and :arg:`crash_reason` gives a hint at the reason.

  The function has the opportunity to perform any cleanup operation, like informing the mudwho server that the mud is down. This can not be done when :master:`remove_player` is called because the udp connectivity is already gone then.

  - If the gamedriver shuts down normally, this is the last function called before the mud shuts down the udp connections and the accepting socket for new players.

  - If the gamedriver crashes, this is the last function called before the mud attempts to dump core and exit. The following crash reasons are defined:

    - "Fatal Error": an internal sanity check failed.

    .. warning:: Since the driver is in an unstable state, this function may not be able to run to completion!

  :history 3.2.9 changed: added the :arg:`crash_reason` argument and that the function is called for a crash at all.

  .. seealso:: :master:`slow_shut_down`, :master:`remove_player`,

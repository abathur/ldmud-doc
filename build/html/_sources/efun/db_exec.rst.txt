.. efun:: int db_exec(int handle, string statement)
  :optional:

  Execute the SQL-statement :arg:`statement` for the connection :arg:`handle` to the SQL-server. The result is the handle if all went okay. If there was an error in the statement, 0 is returned.

  The function is available only if the driver is compiled with mySQL support. In that case, :macro:`__MYSQL__` is defined.

  The efun triggers a privilege violation ("mysql", "db_exec").

  :history 3.2.9 introduced:
  :history 3.2.11 changed: adds the privilege violation.

.. efun:: mixed * command_stack(void)
  :include: <commands.h>

  Return an array describing the current command stack. The array has ``command_stack_depth()`` entries, the first describing the top-level command, and the last describing the current one.

  .. todo:: table below?

  Each entry is an array itself with these entries:

    string [CMD_VERB]:    the verb of this command
    string [CMD_TEXT]:    the full command text
    object [CMD_ORIGIN]:  the original command giver
    object [CMD_PLAYER]:  the current command giver
    mixed  [CMD_FAIL]:    the notify_fail setting (or 0).
    mixed  [CMD_FAILOBJ]: the object which set the notify_fail setting.

  :macro:`CMD_ORIGIN` and :macro:`CMD_PLAYER` are usually the same; there is a difference only if :hook:`H_MODIFY_COMMAND` changes the command giver with :efun:`set_this_player`.

  .. note:: any of the entries may be returned as 0.

  :history 3.2.7 introduced:
  :history 3.2.8 changed: added the :macro:`CMD_FAILOBJ` result

  .. seealso:: :efun:`command`, :efun:`command_stack_depth`, :efun:`notify_fail`

.. efun:: void move_object(mixed item, mixed dest)

  The item, which can be an object_name or an object, is moved into it's new environment dest, which can also be an object_name or an object.

  .. note:: For !compat mode, the traditional implementation required :arg:`item` to be the calling object.

  :history 3.2.1 changed: the innards of move_object() are implemented in the mudlib, using the M_MOVE_OBJECT0/1 driver hooks, and move_object() might as well be an simul-efun

.. efun:: int start_mccp_compress(int telopt)
  :optional:
  :include: <telnet.h>

  This efun must be called inside an interactive player and starts the compression of the driver -> client traffic.

  Returns non-zero on success, and 0 on failure.

  :arg:`telopt` denotes the :topic:`MCCP` version and must be either :macro:`TELOPT_COMPRESS2` or :macro:`TELOPT_COMPRESS` from <telnet.h>.

  The only exception is when the telnet machine is disabled: then any value will do. This can be used with dedicated clients which send text uncompressed but expect to receive it compressed (Java clients using InflaterInputStream for example).

  Available only if the driver is compiled with :topic:`MCCP` enabled; :macro:`__MCCP__` is defined in that case.

  :history 3.3.447/3.2.10 introduced:
  :history 3.3.666 changed: added the possibility to enable outgoing compression when the telnet machine is enabled (not backported to 3.2 series).

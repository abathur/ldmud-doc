.. efun:: mapping filter_indices(mapping, string func, string|object ob, ...)
  mapping filter_indices(mapping, closure cl, ...)

  ``ob->func()`` is called resp. :arg:`cl` applied to every element in the mapping, with first argument being the key of the element, and then the extra args that were given to filter_indices (these args must not be protected references like &(i[0]). If the function returns true, the element is added to the result mapping. :arg:`ob` can also be an object_name of an object.

  If :arg:`ob` is omitted, or neither a string nor an object, it defaults to ``this_object()``.

  .. todo:: below typo of history as "histoy" should maybe get caught somehow? Leave unfixed for now as test case

  :histoy 3.2.6 changed: renamed from ``filter_mapping()`` and generalised by :efun:`filter`.

  .. seealso:: :efun:`filter`, :efun:`map`, :efun:`map_indices`, :efun:`walk_mapping`, :efun:`member`, :efun:`m_contains`

.. efun:: void tls_refresh_certs()
  :experimental:

  Reload the certificates and certificate revocation information.

  If there are no key and certificate files to be found, this efun will keep the current keys and certificates, to keep TLS working. CAs and CRLs are cleared and reloaded in any case.

  .. warning:: when using GnuTLS, a call to :efun:`tls_refresh_certs` while a connection is in the middle of a TLS handshake might cause an incorrect key to be used.

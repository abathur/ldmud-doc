.. efun:: int set_buffer_size(int size)

  Changes the socket buffer size for ``this_interactive()`` to :arg:`size`, up to a preconfigured maximum, result is the old buffer size (or -1 on systems which aren't able to change the socket buffer).

  Modifying the buffer size may result in a better IO throughput, but can also worsen it.

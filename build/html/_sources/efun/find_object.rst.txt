.. efun:: object find_object(string str)

  Find an object with the object_name str. If the object isn't loaded, it will not be found.

  .. usage::

    All four of these statements are equal::

      object obj;
      obj = find_object("std/thing");
      obj = find_object("std/thing.c");
      obj = find_object("/std/thing");
      obj = find_object("/std/thing.c");

    This one, however, returns the clone whose object_name is "std/thing#42", if it exists::

      obj = find_object("/std/thing#42");

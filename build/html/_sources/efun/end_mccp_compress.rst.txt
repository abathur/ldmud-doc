.. efun:: int end_mccp_compress()
  :optional:

  This efun must be called inside an interactive player and stops the compression of the driver -> client traffic.

  Returns non-zero on success, and zero on a failure.

  Available only if the driver is compiled with :topic:`MCCP` enabled; :macro:`__MCCP__` is defined in that case.

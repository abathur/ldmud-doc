.. efun:: string pg_conv_string(string str)
  :optional:

  Convert the string :arg:`str` into a string that is correctly interpretated for usage as a string in :efun:`pg_query`, e.g. ``'`` is replaced with ``\'`` and so on.

  .. todo:: interpretated above _looks_ like a typo of interpreted, but in context I suspect it's actually interpolated?

  The function is available only if the driver is compiled with PostgreSQL support. In that case, :macro:`__PGSQL__` is defined.

  The efun triggers a privilege violation ("pgsql", "pg_connect").

.. efun:: string query_verb(void)
  string query_verb(int flag)

  Return the verb of the current command, of 0 if not executing from a command. If :arg:`flag` is 0 or not given, the verb as given by the user is returned (this is the first word from the line input by the player, up to but not including the first space or lineend). If :arg:`flag` is non-0, the verb as specified in the :efun:`add_action` statement is returned.

  .. usage::

    When the user is in the presence of an object defined as::

      void init() {
         ...
         add_action("sing","sing");
         add_action("sing","chant", 1);
         ...
      }
      int sing(string str) {
         write("Your command was: "+query_verb()+(str ? str : "")+"\n");
         write("The action verb was: "+query_verb(1)+(str ? str : "")+"\n");
         return 1;
      }

    the command 'sing ...' will print::

      Your command was: sing
      The action verb was: sing

    the command 'chant ...' will print::

      Your command was: chant
      The action verb was: chant

    and the command 'chantit ...' will print::

      Your command was: chantit
      The action verb was: chant

  :history 3.2.9 changed: added the optional flag argument.

.. efun:: void configure_interactive(object ob, int what, mixed data)
  :include: <configuration.h>

  Sets the option :arg:`what` to the value :arg:`data` on the interactive :arg:`ob` or the default for all interactives if :arg:`ob` is 0.

  If the first argument :arg:`ob` is not ``this_object()``, the privilege violation ("configure_interactive", this_object(), ob, what, data) occurs.

  .. todo:: privilege violation

  As :arg:`what`, the following arguments are accepted:

  :arg:`what` == :macro:`IC_MAX_WRITE_BUFFER_SIZE`
    Sets the maximum amount of data to be held pending for writing per player to :arg:`data` bytes. A value of -1 means unlimited, 0 deactivates the write buffer.

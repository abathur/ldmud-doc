.. efun:: string * last_instructions(int length, int verbose)

  Returns an array showing the 'length' last executed instructions in disassembled form. If 'verbose' is non-zero (the default), line number information are also included. Each string is built as this::

    Opcode-Address: Opcode Operand Mnemonic (Stackdepth) Linenumber

  The Stackdepth information consists of two numbers :samp:`{rel}:{abs}` *rel* is the relative stack usage in this function, *abs* is the absolute stack usage.

  The linenumber information is appended if requested and a new source line is reached. Also, calls between objects produce a::

    Objectname Programname Linenumber

  entry in the resulting array (in verbose mode only).

  There is a preconfigured upper limit for the backtrace.

  .. todo:: is there an actual define to cite for predef above?

  :history 3.2.1@34 introduced:
  :history 3.2.8 changed: added absolute stack depth information

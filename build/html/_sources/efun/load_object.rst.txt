.. efun:: object load_object(string name)

  Load the object from the file :arg:`name` (which can not be empty) and return it. If the object already exists, just return it.

  This efun can be used only to load blueprints; for clones, use :efun:`clone_object`.

  If strict euids are enforced, the cloning object must have a non-zero euid.

  .. usage::

    Update and reload the standard player object::

      destruct(find_object("/std/player"));
      load_object("/std/player");

  :history 3.2.6 introduced:
  :history 3.3.716 changed: requires that :arg:`name` is not empty.

  .. seealso:: :efun:`clone_object`

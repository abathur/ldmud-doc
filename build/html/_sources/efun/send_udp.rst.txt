.. efun:: int send_udp(string host, int port, string message)
  int send_udp(string host, int port, int * message)

  Sends the :arg:`message` in an UDP packet to the given host and port number.

  The efun causes the privilege violation ("send_udp").

  Returns 1 on success, 0 on failure.

  .. note:: On some machines a failed :efun:`send_udp` will not be registered until the next :efun:`send_udp` - the latter one might return '0' even if itself was successful.

  .. limit:: If the :arg:`host` is given as a fully qualified name (instead of an IP address), the execution will block until the name is resolved.

  :history 3.2.9 changed: renamed this efun from send_imp(), and also changed the privilege violation string and the apply names.

  .. seealso:: :efun:`query_udp_port`, :master:`receive_udp`

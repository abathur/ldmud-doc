.. efun:: string make_shared_string(string str)
  :deprecated:

  Puts :arg:`str` in the table of shared strings of the game.

  If the string is used by several variables/objects this saves memory. Keys of alists and mappings are always shared strings.

  In LDMud 3.3, this function is no longer necessary: strings are shared as much as possible anyway, and the driver automatically converts untabled strings into tabled strings after some time.

  .. todo:: tempted to move above paragraph *into* the history note on the deprecation, which I've done below; compare and decide.

  :history 3.2.6 introduced: following a suggestion from Tubmud.
  :history 3.3.531 deprecated: This function is no longer necessary because strings are shared as much as possible anyway, and the driver automatically converts untabled strings into tabled strings after some time.

<h2>DESCRIPTION<a class="headerlink" href="#DESCRIPTION" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>During the evolution of LPMud there has been a hiatus as the
old driver became too restricting for the demands of modern
muds: it did a lot of things the mudlib could do better or
completely different. Removing these things from the driver
weren&#8217;t a problem, but to keep compatible with the existing
mudlibs (namely the well-known 2.4.5 lib), it was possible to
undo these changes. First by setting a runtime option, then
by compiling the driver either in &#8216;compat&#8217; or in &#8216;native&#8217; mode.</p>
<p>Starting with 3.2.1, the distinction between compat and native
mode is more and more transferred into the mudlib, with the
future goal of having a modeless driver.</p>
<p>Starting with 3.2.7, native mode no longer exists as such,
only &#8216;plain&#8217; (quasi a superset of &#8216;native&#8217; and &#8216;compat&#8217;)
and &#8216;compat&#8217; mode, and since 3.2.9 the mode selection can be
made via commandline option.</p>
<p>The main mode of the driver is determined at compile time
by preprocessor symbols to be defined/undefined in config.h:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><dl class="docutils">
<dt>COMPAT_MODE: when defined, the compat mode specifics are activated</dt>
<dd>by default.</dd>
</dl>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Additional modifications can be achieved by the specification
of commandline arguments (most of them have a default setting
entry in config.h as well):</p>
<blockquote>
<div>strict-euids: when active, euid usage is enforced.
compat:       when active, the compat mode is used.</div></blockquote>
<p>Following is the description of the changes (de) activated by
these defines. A shorthand notation is used: &#8216;compat&#8217; means
&#8216;if compat mode is active&#8217; and &#8216;!compat&#8217; means &#8216;if
compat mode is not active&#8217;, etc.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Predefined Preprocessor Symbols</dt>
<dd>If compat, the symbols COMPAT_FLAG and __COMPAT_MODE__ are
defined for all LPC programs.
If strict-euids, the symbol __STRICT_EUIDS__ is defined
for all LPC programs.
For compatibility reasons, the symbol __EUIDS__ is defined
for all LPC programs all the time.</dd>
<dt>Preloading Of Objects</dt>
<dd>The driver has the possibility to preload objects before the
game is actually opened to the world. This is done by
calling master-&gt;epilog(), which has to return 0 or an array.
If its an array, its elements (as long as they are strings)
are given one by one as argument to master-&gt;preload() which
may now preload the objects (or do anything else).</dd>
<dt>Initialisation Of Objects</dt>
<dd><p class="first">It is task of the mudlib (through the driver hooks) to call
the initialisation lfuns in newly created objects. The
following table shows the traditional calls:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><blockquote>
<div>mode        : init call : reset call</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>!compat &amp; !native :  create() :  reset(1)
!compat &amp;  native :  create() :  reset()</p>
<blockquote>
<div>compat &amp; !native :  reset(0) :  reset(1)
compat &amp;  native :  reset(0) :  reset(1)</div></blockquote>
</div></blockquote>
</div></blockquote>
<p class="last">If INITIALIZATION_BY___INIT was defined, the lfun __INIT()
is called first on creation to initialize the objects
variables.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Movement Of Objects</dt>
<dd><p class="first">The efun move_object() is implemented in the mudlib through
driver hooks and the set_environment() efun.
move_object() itself exists just for convenience and
compatibility.</p>
<p>In original native mode, move_object() could applied only to
this_object() as the object to move, and it called the lfun
exit() in the old environment if in compat mode. As a side
effect, the lfun exit() may not be target of add_action()s
in compat mode.</p>
<p class="last">In compat mode, objects may be moved using the transfer()
efun. It does make assumptions about the design of the
mudlib, though, as it calls the lfuns query_weight(),
can_put_and_get(), get(), prevent_insert() and add_weight().</p>
</dd>
<dt>Efuns In General</dt>
<dd><dl class="first last docutils">
<dt>creator(), transfer()</dt>
<dd>These exist only in compat mode (creator() is
identical with getuid()).</dd>
<dt>object_name(), function_exists()</dt>
<dd>In !compat mode, the returned filenames start with a
leading &#8216;/&#8217;, in compat mode they don&#8217;t.</dd>
<dt>parse_command()</dt>
<dd>This command exists in two versions: the old is used with
compat, the new with !compat. However,
SUPPLY_PARSE_COMMAND must be defined in config.h in both
cases (this efun is not very useful at all).</dd>
<dt>process_string()</dt>
<dd>If this_object() doesn&#8217;t exist, it defaults to this_player()
and receives the backbone uid (returned by master-&gt;get_bb_uid())
as euid. If strict-euids, this uid must not be 0.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>Userids and Effective Userids</dt>
<dd><p class="first">This is probably the most important difference between the
modes.</p>
<p>LPMud always had userids (uids) attributing the objects,
though they were called &#8216;creator names&#8217; in compat mode.
Internally, the compat mode uses the &#8216;creator names&#8217; as
(e)uid.</p>
<p>With the introduction of native/plain mode, additionally
&#8216;effective userids&#8217; (euids) were introduced to improve
security handling (which was only a partial success).
The hardcoded handling of euids and uids was quite complex
and too mudlib-insensitive, so most of it got moved from the
driver into the mudlib with 3.2.1.</p>
<p>In strict-euids mode, only objects with a non-zero euid may load
or create new objects.</p>
<p>&#8212; In Detail &#8212;</p>
<blockquote class="last">
<div><dl class="docutils">
<dt>Userids of the Master</dt>
<dd><p class="first">The master&#8217;s (e)uid is determined by a call to
master-&gt;get_master_uid().</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>In strict-euids mode, the result has to be a string,</dt>
<dd>otherwise the driver won&#8217;t start up at all. If the result is
valid it is set as the master&#8217;s uid and euid.</dd>
<dt>In !strict-euids mode, the result may be any value: 0 or a</dt>
<dd>string are treated as the uid to set, a non-zero integer
leads to the use of the uid set in the default &#8216;global&#8217;

or to 0.</dd>
</dl>

<dt>Userids of New Objects</dt>
<dd><p class="first">To determine the (e)uids for a new object (loaded or

euid is set to 0, or an array ({ uid, euid }).</p>
<dl class="last docutils">
<dt>In strict-euids mode, both uid and euid must be 0 or a string,</dt>
<dd>any other value causes the load/clone to fail.</dd>
<dt>In !strict-euids mode, the uid (however returned) may also be</dt>
<dd>a non-zero integer to use the uid of the global

set to either 0 or the second entry of the returned
array if it&#8217;s a string.</dd>

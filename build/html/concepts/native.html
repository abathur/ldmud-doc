<div class="admonition-todo admonition" id="index-0">
<p class="first admonition-title">Todo</p>
<p class="last">partial rewrite using a few semantic structures</p>
</div>
<p>During the evolution of LPMud there has been a hiatus as the old driver became too restricting for the demands of modern muds: it did a lot of things the mudlib could do better or completely different. Removing these things from the driver weren&#8217;t a problem, but to keep compatible with the existing mudlibs (namely the well-known 2.4.5 lib), it was possible to undo these changes. First by setting a runtime option, then by compiling the driver either in &#8216;compat&#8217; or in &#8216;native&#8217; mode.</p>
<p>Starting with 3.2.1, the distinction between compat and native mode is more and more transferred into the mudlib, with the future goal of having a modeless driver.</p>
<p>Starting with 3.2.7, native mode no longer exists as such, only &#8216;plain&#8217; (quasi a superset of &#8216;native&#8217; and &#8216;compat&#8217;) and &#8216;compat&#8217; mode, and since 3.2.9 the mode selection can be made via commandline option.</p>
<p>The main mode of the driver is determined at compile time by preprocessor symbols to be defined/undefined in config.h:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><dl class="docutils">
<dt>COMPAT_MODE: when defined, the compat mode specifics are activated</dt>
<dd>by default.</dd>
</dl>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Additional modifications can be achieved by the specification of commandline arguments (most of them have a default setting entry in config.h as well):</p>
<blockquote>
<div>strict-euids: when active, euid usage is enforced.
compat:       when active, the compat mode is used.</div></blockquote>
<p>Following is the description of the changes (de) activated by these defines. A shorthand notation is used: &#8216;compat&#8217; means &#8216;if compat mode is active&#8217; and &#8216;!compat&#8217; means &#8216;if compat mode is not active&#8217;, etc.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Predefined Preprocessor Symbols</dt>
<dd>If compat, the symbols COMPAT_FLAG and __COMPAT_MODE__ are defined for all LPC programs.
If strict-euids, the symbol __STRICT_EUIDS__ is defined for all LPC programs.
For compatibility reasons, the symbol __EUIDS__ is defined for all LPC programs all the time.</dd>
<dt>Preloading Of Objects</dt>
<dd>The driver has the possibility to preload objects before the game is actually opened to the world. This is done by calling master-&gt;epilog(), which has to return 0 or an array. If its an array, its elements (as long as they are strings) are given one by one as argument to master-&gt;preload() which may now preload the objects (or do anything else).</dd>
<dt>Initialisation Of Objects</dt>
<dd><p class="first">It is task of the mudlib (through the driver hooks) to call the initialisation lfuns in newly created objects. The following table shows the traditional calls:</p>
<div class="highlight-c"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>       <span class="nl">mode</span>        <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">init</span> <span class="nl">call</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">reset</span> <span class="n">call</span>
<span class="o">--------------------------------------------</span>
 <span class="o">!</span><span class="n">compat</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="o">!</span><span class="nl">native</span> <span class="p">:</span>  <span class="n">create</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">:</span>  <span class="n">reset</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
 <span class="o">!</span><span class="n">compat</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span>  <span class="nl">native</span> <span class="p">:</span>  <span class="n">create</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">:</span>  <span class="n">reset</span><span class="p">()</span>
  <span class="n">compat</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="o">!</span><span class="nl">native</span> <span class="p">:</span>  <span class="n">reset</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">:</span>  <span class="n">reset</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="n">compat</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span>  <span class="nl">native</span> <span class="p">:</span>  <span class="n">reset</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">:</span>  <span class="n">reset</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p class="last">If INITIALIZATION_BY___INIT was defined, the lfun __INIT() is called first on creation to initialize the objects variables.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Movement Of Objects</dt>
<dd><p class="first">The efun move_object() is implemented in the mudlib through driver hooks and the set_environment() efun. move_object() itself exists just for convenience and compatibility.</p>
<p>In original native mode, move_object() could applied only to this_object() as the object to move, and it called the lfun exit() in the old environment if in compat mode. As a side effect, the lfun exit() may not be target of add_action()s in compat mode.</p>
<p class="last">In compat mode, objects may be moved using the transfer() efun. It does make assumptions about the design of the mudlib, though, as it calls the lfuns query_weight(), can_put_and_get(), get(), prevent_insert() and add_weight().</p>
</dd>
<dt>Efuns In General</dt>
<dd><dl class="first last docutils">
<dt>creator(), transfer()</dt>
<dd>These exist only in compat mode (creator() is identical with getuid()).</dd>
<dt>object_name(), function_exists()</dt>
<dd>In !compat mode, the returned filenames start with a leading &#8216;/&#8217;, in compat mode they don&#8217;t.</dd>
<dt>parse_command()</dt>
<dd>This command exists in two versions: the old is used with compat, the new with !compat. However, SUPPLY_PARSE_COMMAND must be defined in config.h in both cases (this efun is not very useful at all).</dd>
<dt>process_string()</dt>
<dd>If this_object() doesn&#8217;t exist, it defaults to this_player() and receives the backbone uid (returned by master-&gt;get_bb_uid()) as euid. If strict-euids, this uid must not be 0.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>Userids and Effective Userids</dt>
<dd><p class="first">This is probably the most important difference between the modes.</p>
<p>LPMud always had userids (uids) attributing the objects, though they were called &#8216;creator names&#8217; in compat mode. Internally, the compat mode uses the &#8216;creator names&#8217; as (e)uid.</p>
<p>With the introduction of native/plain mode, additionally &#8216;effective userids&#8217; (euids) were introduced to improve security handling (which was only a partial success). The hardcoded handling of euids and uids was quite complex and too mudlib-insensitive, so most of it got moved from the driver into the mudlib with 3.2.1.</p>
<p>In strict-euids mode, only objects with a non-zero euid may load or create new objects.</p>
<p>&#8212; In Detail &#8212;</p>
<blockquote class="last">
<div><dl class="docutils">
<dt>Userids of the Master</dt>
<dd><p class="first">The master&#8217;s (e)uid is determined by a call to master-&gt;get_master_uid().</p>
<p>In strict-euids mode, the result has to be a string, otherwise the driver won&#8217;t start up at all. If the result is valid it is set as the master&#8217;s uid and euid.</p>
<p>In !strict-euids mode, the result may be any value: 0 or a string are treated as the uid to set, a non-zero integer leads to the use of the uid set in the default &#8216;global&#8217; wizlist entry, and any other value defaults to 0. The euid is either set to the returned string (if any), or to 0.</p>
<p class="last">The master&#8217;s uid is determined only on startup this way; at runtime the uids of a reloaded master determined as for every object by a call to the appropriate driver hooks.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Userids of New Objects</dt>
<dd><p class="first">To determine the (e)uids for a new object (loaded or inherited, or cloned), the appropriate driver hook is evaluated (H_LOAD_UIDS, H_CLONE_UIDS) and the result set as (e)uid. The result may be a single value, in which case the euid is set to 0, or an array ({ uid, euid }).</p>
<p>In strict-euids mode, both uid and euid must be 0 or a string, any other value causes the load/clone to fail.</p>
<p class="last">In !strict-euids mode, the uid (however returned) may also be a non-zero integer to use the uid of the global wizlist entry as uid. The euid is then set to either 0 or the second entry of the returned array if it&#8217;s a string.</p>

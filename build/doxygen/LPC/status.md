status {#driver_LPC_status}
===========================
@par obsolete:status was planned to be an optimized boolean format, but this was never actually implemented. status does work; however, since it is only an alias for type 'int', just use int.

@see @ref driver_LPC_int "int", @ref driver_LPC_types "types"

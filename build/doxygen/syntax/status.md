status {#driver_syntax_status}
==============================
@par obsolete: status was planned to be an optimized boolean format, but this was never actually implemented. Status does work since it is only an alias for @ref driver_syntax_int "int"--but just use @ref driver_syntax_int "int".

See Also: 
   @ref driver_syntax_int "int", @ref driver_syntax_types "types"

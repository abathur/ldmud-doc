.. concept:: files

  As a wizard, you are working with files. Each file represents the bulding plan for one or more objects (except text or doc files of course).

  The mudlib has a root, and when working with filenames, you can always specify a full pathname from the root by starting with a '/' (slash) at the beginning of the file name.

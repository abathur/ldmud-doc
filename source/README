Introduction
============
If you are new to ldmud, skim this file to see how the docs are organized before moving on to the :overview:`overview` in this directory. The overview will give you a sense of what is covered and introduce some terms used here that you may not be familiar with.

Organization
============
Once you know the basics, the docs you'll use most are the API and language references in:

- :directory:`applied/`
- :directory:`efun/`
- :directory:`hook/`
- :directory:`master/`
- :directory:`syntax/`

Outside of the API and syntax references, the docs are organized by document type:


Overviews
    Roadmaps (stored in the doc root) to the broad strokes of the documentation.

Tutorials
    Functional step-by-step introductions to performing practical tasks. In tutorials/.

Guides
    Blend conceptual information and sample code into a longer, well-rounded examination of some non-trivial subject. In guides/.

Examples
    Brief practical demonstrations of a feature or concept. In examples/.

Topics
    Concise technical or conceptual definitions of a subject or feature and closely-related subtopics. In topics/.

.. I like the idea of having an include each mud can modify to document the layout of their mudlib docs, but I'm not sure if it should be here, in the overview, or perhaps split between both in some way.

.. include:: mudlib-dunno.rst
